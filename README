LUNA, short for "Lightweight Universal Network Analyzer", is a system
to analyze network behavior under different network loads. LUNA can
generate UDP packets following configured distributions and record
their arrivals. It also includes tools to analyze the resulting packet
logs and a remote control system to simplify setting up experiments
involving many hosts.

LUNA has been developed by Fiona Klute as part of her graduation
thesis, which is available online at:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.9907

src/		C source code of the traffic generator

evaluation/	Octave scripts and related stuff to evalutate the
		output from LUNA

remote-control/	Remote control script for distributed use

Build dependencies: Full autotools, modern GCC and glibc, libgsl

The remote control script also needs the Net::OpenSSH package (and
OpenSSH, of course).

List of required Debian packages (might be incomplete, please report
if something is missing):
	build-essential
	autoconf-archive
	libgsl0-dev
	libnet-openssh-perl

After a cloning the Git repository you'll need to run "autoreconf -i"
or "autoreconf -i -s" to initialize the autoconf system. For your
convenience, there is also an "autogen.sh" script which will take care
of that. Afterwards please follow the common "./configure && make &&
make install" procedure.

Please send bug reports or patches to the author by mail or through
the Github issue tracker (https://github.com/airtower-luna/luna/issues).
