LUNA, short for "Lightweight Universal Network Analyzer", is a system
to analyze network behavior under different network loads. LUNA can
generate UDP packets following configured distributions and record
their arrivals. It also includes tools to analyze the resulting packet
logs and a remote control system to simplify setting up experiments
involving many hosts.

src/		C source code of the traffic generator

evaluation/	Octave scripts and related stuff to evalutate the
		output from LUNA

remote-control/	Remote control script for distributed use

Build dependencies: Full autotools, modern GCC and glibc, libgsl

The remote control script also needs the Net::OpenSSH package (and
OpenSSH, of course).
